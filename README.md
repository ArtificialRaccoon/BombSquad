# BombSquad
A WPF based Mastermind Clone

The computer has been rigged with a bomb!  Guess the defusal code from a combination of six different colours and disarm the bomb.  A failed attempt nets you two valuable clues towards solving the code:
1.  The number of Colours in the correct position within the input
2.  The number of Colours in your input which exist within the secret defusal code

Current Status:
Playable to completion, but using up all your chances doesn't currently trigger a game over (though you can no longer enter any new defuse attempts).  Graphically it is primitive and imcomplete (ie: the clues arn't labeled nor obviously, etc).
